"""Canonical, model-blind event and decision types for the Excubitor policy core.

These are the two value types every policy speaks: a normalized `PreToolEvent` in, a `Decision` out.
A runtime adapter builds a `PreToolEvent` from a native pre-execution hook payload (a host's own
pre-tool event, or a generic JSON envelope); the pure policy functions consume it and return a
`Decision`; the adapter renders that decision back into the host's native veto shape. See
`docs/design/model-agnostic-runtime.md` (§"Canonical event contract") for the per-host mappings —
the host names live in that design doc and in the adapters, never in this neutral module.

Two design rules are load-bearing and are enforced by tests:

1. **The passing outcome is named `pass`, never `allow`.** `pass` means *Excubitor has no objection;
   preserve the host's normal permission flow*. Several hosts treat an explicit native "allow" as a
   grant that SKIPS the user's permission prompt — so the core must never emit one. Adapters render
   `pass` as no-decision / empty success, and only `deny` as a structured veto.

2. **The core is model-blind and host-free.** No field carries a model identity, and policies must
   never branch on `runtime` (it is telemetry/diagnostics only). This module is pure data — stdlib
   types only, with no host coupling: it starts no child processes, reads no host configuration or
   global paths, and hard-codes no runtime name.

`PreToolEvent.from_dict`/generic-protocol parsing, the full malformed-input fixture matrix, and the
`allow`→`pass` migration of the legacy `runtime/spec_adapter.py` envelope are deliberately NOT here —
they belong to the generic-protocol unit (`excubitor.pre_tool.v1`, plan item C1.9). This module only
defines the types and their outward (`to_dict`) serialization.

    * ``targets``       — EVERY file the tool may mutate (a patch can touch several); never just the
      first path. Held as a tuple so the event stays immutable.
